## Demos

These are some demos that I have prepared for the talk.
The demos are written in Crystal, and are meant to be run with the `crystal` command.
The demos are meant to be run in the same directory as the `crystal` command, just enter the directory and run demo by demo.

#### 1. Hello EuRuKo.

This is a simple demo that prints "Hello EuRuKo!" to the console.

#### 2. Greeter.

This is a simple demo that greets the user with a personalized message.

#### 3. Fibers.

This is a simple demo that shows how to use fibers.

#### 4. Channels.

This is a simple demo that shows how to use channels.

#### 5. Basic Server.

This is a basic HTTP server that responds with a simple "Hello world!" message.

> Note: Please, to run every program, just enter the command `crystal` and then the program name.
